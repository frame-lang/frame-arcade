# Per-location canon reference

Auto-generated from `cca/canon/advent.dat` and the port's 
`cca/godot/scripts/topology.gd`. Don't hand-edit this file — 
regenerate via `python3 cca/canon/gen_locations.py > cca/CANON_LOCATIONS.md`.

The travel-table dest decoder is a direct transcription of the spec 
at `cca/canon/advent.for` lines 105-122 (the FORTRAN comment block 
that defines the canonical `Y = M*1000 + N` encoding).

Each location lists the canon long-form description, every canon 
section-3 travel-table row that exits the room (decoded), the rooms 
that lead in, any object/treasure/NPC placed there per canon section 
7, and the port's current implementation status.
